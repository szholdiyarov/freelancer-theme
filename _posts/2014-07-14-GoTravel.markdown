description: <h3></h3><font color="#334d4d"> GoTravel is my another project which is currently under the development. <br/> Main idea of this app is to allow users get the up-to-date tourist guidelines and calendar which will generate the trip for additional prices. We have 3 developers who are working on its implementation. We are using Firebase as a backend service where we store tour guildelines, promos, discounts etc.
