description: Kurs Tenge is a simple application which shows up-to-the-minute exchange rates, historical charts and includes a rates calculator. This app was the first application which I shipped to the market. Technical description. This application was written in 1 day as part of companys internal hackathon. It parses rss feed(in xml) provided by api , writes new rates to file and finally present them to user. At the time when I was developing this app I had no idea that magical tools like reactive programming(rxJava) and retrofit with GSONs are exist(forgive me this please I was early-junior), but I remember that I tried to follow MVC pattern. So, an activity is my controller, rates are models and views are fragments. To show smooth history rates diagram all calculations are done in AsynkTask(now I know that there are better ways for this).
